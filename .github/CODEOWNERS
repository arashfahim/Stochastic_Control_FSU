# Example CODEOWNERS file
# Format: <pattern> <owner> <owner> ...
# Owners can be users: @username
# Or teams: @org/team-name (teams only in org repos)
# The last matching rule takes precedence.

# All files in the repo — assign to you
* @arashfahim

# All files in the docs folder — docs team in org (example)
docs/ @my-org/docs-team

# All JavaScript in src/ — frontend team and lead
src/**/*.js @my-org/frontend-team @frontend-lead

# Anything under src/components (directory)
src/components/ @my-org/frontend-team

# Markdown files — docs maintainers and a user
*.md @my-org/docs-team @doc-editor
